        					<strong>Shop going online</strong>
        					<p>Food ordering online is becoming a norm for restaurants which offer takeout and delivery orders. Food ordering online is designed as it is cost effective yet an efficient system to satisfy the restaurant’s needs. The system is also designed for its ultimate flexibility and performance. The customers will be able to access into the company existing website and browse at their menu and select and place their orders on what they desire. Once they have completed their order, the system will either email or fax the customer’s order to the restaurant. The online ordering system also enables customers to order days beforehand and the system will execute the order at the specified time. The system has been built to handle large amounts of traffic simultaneously to prevent a system overload.
This system is also flexible in a way, whereby customers are able to place online orders quickly, with just a ‘click’ comparing to the tradition where orders were taken through the phone. More time and cost will be saved ordering online as a phone bill is charged according to the time the phone is on the line. The system was used intended to meet the requirements of all of the clients.
